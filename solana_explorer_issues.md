## Issue #566: [Feature Request] Add block level compute unit utilization

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @fikunmi-ap  
**Created:** 2025-04-24T19:33:24Z  
**Updated:** 2025-04-29T15:40:59Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/566](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/566)  
**Comments:** 2

### Description

Currently, users can only see the transaction-level CU usage, but block level data requires manual calculation. It would be extremely useful to have block level data and it should be a trivial lift from the current setup.

Waiting on RPC to implement parsing for t22 extensions. Will leave up until we add UI for it though

@ngundotra I believe it is all in v2.2 which is being rolled out (25% adoption right now)

## Issue #513: Set default enable custom url param to be TRUE not FALSE

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @hwsimmons17  
**Created:** 2025-03-26T19:23:31Z  
**Updated:** 2025-04-29T17:55:07Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/513](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/513)  
**Comments:** 6

### Description

The default for the setting `enableCustomUrl` is false, not true. This makes it so a link such as https://explorer.solana.com/tx/39sSZMXZ8rgXuDLvCswcQ5i9XTzfa3KNVcr1fnjSJxKEh2Lza4vXpnW8iGh9UjEw5dZ3xHAC8fikJbSZ2ZD6rHDK?cluster=custom&customUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fengine.mirror.ad%2Frpc%2Fa5a744b7-f306-4e96-a204-43a26d73dd51 (note this will have expired by the time you click it), just resets to http://localhost:8899. In essence there is no way to have a link that links to the Solana Explorer for a custom url.

### Comment by @hwsimmons17 on 2025-03-26T19:26:50Z

In thinking about this, I understand the restriction to set it off by default (a scammer could send you a link to a bad link) however they could send you something to devnet anyway, like look I sent you money or whatever, and if you don't understand Solana you may be scammed, but this doesn't really stop that.

Honestly would love to understand why this is here in the first place

This is pretty obvious to me that you are on a custom rpc url, i.e. be careful...

---

### Comment by @ngundotra on 2025-03-26T19:41:54Z

Hey thanks for flagging this @hwsimmons17 . Not going to implement this because of possibility for malicious actors to link users to a version of the explorer that sends user info to unknown 3rd party URLs.

Will remove this



---

### Comment by @ngundotra on 2025-03-26T19:42:27Z

Would a specific localhost cluster param work?

---

### Comment by @hwsimmons17 on 2025-03-26T20:01:03Z

No, the use case here is we provide lightweight Solana instances, lightweight enough where you can run your code in the browser against your own small Solana instance. Each cluster is a url unique to the user, so something generic wouldn't work here

## Issue #485: [Bug] Inspector - Trying to access beyond buffer length

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @loopcreativeandy  
**Created:** 2025-03-06T14:08:45Z  
**Updated:** 2025-04-29T15:46:07Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/485](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/485)  
**Comments:** 4

### Description

**Describe the bug**
When pasting a specific payload into the inpsector raw data field, the application will error 
"Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information)."
Looking at console reveals "Trying to access beyond buffer length"

**To Reproduce**
I've narrowed it down to one specific instruction that causes this behaviour. 
Here is a transaction payload with this instruction:

`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`

The odd thing: I did not manage to reproduce this locally. When cloning the repo and runing locally everything works just fine. Only when pasting that payload at the [Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/inspector) the application crashes.

**Expected behavior**
The app should not crash but correctly deserialize and show the transaction.


**Additional context**
I came across this when trying to help answer a [question](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/20476/squads-reached-end-of-buffer-unexpectedly/20668#20668) on Stack Exchange.

### Comments

### Comment by @jgur-psyops on 2025-03-06T17:34:16Z

We have since approved this in squads and executed on mainnet so can verify that the tx was valid (but obviously this limits your ability to sim it!): https://solana.fm/tx/45dZMcZmAnv3FhxZw1VWBPNMieFHht2FyjsXooC5Rg7vrq932zxH5Lra9NyzBJRNFX8BGNrnFajdyKC5Lr9BYFkT?cluster=mainnet-alpha

### Comment by @ngundotra on 2025-03-07T13:43:56Z

Thanks for flagging this. Will look into solving this

---

### Comment by @ngundotra on 2025-03-07T16:21:08Z

Not sure yet what's happening, but fixed the application crash in #487. 

Seems like neither Solana FM nor Explorer can decode that instruction data. Will do some more debugging.

### Comments

### Comment by @ngundotra on 2025-03-10T18:43:44Z

Can you provide a repro? Nothing in package.json should be allocating `test-ledger/`. 

You may have accidentally run `solana-test-validator` in the same root folder, which may be why you are seeing `test-ledger/`.

## Issue #468: [Bug] USD Coin address page shows wrong layout

**Status:** open  
**Author:** @rogaldh  
**Created:** 2025-02-20T17:53:27Z  
**Updated:** 2025-02-20T21:58:48Z

**Comments:** 1

### Description

**Describe the bug**

Today I've faced this issue with USDC and USDT pages at the explorer on the mainnet. Here is the link for USDC: https://explorer.solana.com/address/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v

After visiting this page explorer shows me generic token layout but with USDC.

I tinkered it a bit and:
- page reload itself at some point to the proper layout
- couple of times manual page reload helped to show proper layout


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to [USD Coin](https://explorer.solana.com/address/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v)
2. See generic token layout instead of USD Coin one

**Example Links**

-   [Link to USD Coin](https://explorer.solana.com/address/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v)

**Expected behavior**
I should see USD Coin layout by default.

**Screenshots**

### Description

When searching for anything inside the Explorer search box, we should force alter the order of results that get displayed to the user. Specifically to show programs and domain results first before tokens.

So the end goal of order should be:
- domains
- programs
- tokens

## Issue #456: [Bug] Program Verification Displayed Incorrectly After Program Is Made Immutable

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @swaroop-osec  
**Created:** 2025-02-05T11:44:41Z

**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/456](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/456)  
**Comments:** 0

### Description

Since Solana Explorer checks the upgrade authority against the signer of the verification PDA when displaying program verification details, in cases where a program has been made immutable after PDA creation, this check fails and results in incorrect or misleading information.

Example
- [Mayan Finance](https://explorer.solana.com/address/B96dV3Luxzo6SokJx3xt8i5y8Mb7HRR6Eec8hCjJDT69/verified-build)

## Issue #446: [Bug] OSEC Verify Endpoint Outage Crashes Explorer

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @thebeanogamer  
**Created:** 2025-01-27T11:10:06Z  
**Updated:** 2025-01-28T22:31:14Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/446](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/446)  
**Comments:** 1

### Description

**Describe the bug**
The OSEC Verify endpoint is currently unavailable (https://github.com/otter-sec/solana-verified-programs-api/issues/64) which is causing unusual behaviour in the Explorer.

The `Verified Build` line in the Program Account overview shows `Source Code Not Provided` (1) which is wrong but understandable. However if you click on the `Verified Build` tab (2) the Explorer will outright crash and require a reload.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc25ab67-709a-40ce-8e7e-e10a4f8371f9)

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Wait for the OSEC Verify endpoint to be down or build the Explorer locally with a deliberately unreachable URL
2. Go to <https://explorer.solana.com/address/PhoeNiXZ8ByJGLkxNfZRnkUfjvmuYqLR89jjFHGqdXY>
3. See `Source Code Not Provided`
4. Click on the `Verified Build` tab

**Example Links**

-   <https://explorer.solana.com/address/PhoeNiXZ8ByJGLkxNfZRnkUfjvmuYqLR89jjFHGqdXY>

**Expected behavior**
The UI should cleanly report that the OSEC Verify endpoint was unreachable in both areas where data from it are displayed.

## Issue #423: [Bug] devnet blocks returned instead of mainnet blocks

**Status:** closed

**Comments:** 2

### Description

**Describe the bug**
On and around `2024-12-03 16:03:15.529 UTC` we fetched devnet blocks instead of mainnet blocks from api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

The RPC method we used was `getBlock`

**To Reproduce**
Unfortunately un-reproducible

**Expected behavior**
We'd expect only mainnet blocks to be returned when querying https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com


Additionally, what's the easiest way to quickly distinguish a devnet block from a mainnet block? For Bitcoin for example the address format is not the same.

## Issue #422: [Bug] RPC HTTP errors in UI silently fail.

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @mikemaccana  
**Created:** 2024-12-02T21:44:23Z  
**Updated:** 2024-12-19T17:12:13Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/422](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/422)  
**Comments:** 1

### Description

**Describe the bug**

HTTP errors aren't shown in the Explorer UI, make it seem like Explorer is at fault when RPC may just not allow a particular call.

Use third party RPC URL via Custom RPC URL on the explorer homepage.

It will look like stops all data loading.

In reality, `getClusterStatus` RPC call isn't allowed on the third party RPC.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to https://dashboard.helius.dev/endpoints
2. Copy the RPC URL (eg https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
3. Visit https://explorer.solana.com/ and use the URL as a 'Custom RPC URL'. Enable 'Enable custom url param'. You will end up with a URL like: https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=custom&customUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmainnet.helius-rpc.com%2F%3Fapi-key%3Dxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
4. See

- Enable 'Enable custom url param' - I don't understand what this does - the 'customUrl' param appears whether I enable this or not, and I don't understand why anyone using a custom RPC URL would _not_ want `customUrl` in their parameters.

**Example Links**

https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=custom&customUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmainnet.helius-rpc.com%2F%3Fapi-key%3Dxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (get your own Helius API key at https://dashboard.helius.dev/endpoints)

**Expected behavior**
~Explorer to use the custom RPC URL. Additionally the 'Enable Custom URL pattern' should probably not exist since it doesn't seem to do anything.~

Show a toaster UI with 'Error: 429 method not allowed from RPC' or similar.

**Screenshots**

**Additional context**

### Comments

### Comment by @mikemaccana on 2024-12-03T22:57:37Z

@ngundotra Updated the bug per my discovery earlier - as mentioned, Helius doesn't allow cluster stats so returns a 429 when viewing the Explorer home page, the Explorer UI just doesn't show the error.

While the current tx inspector is useful, it would be even better to provide this information via an API. This would allow developers to enhance their transaction presentation during signing to reduce blind signing and increase user confidence in their transactions.

Hey @7layermagik  you can only get up to 512 of the last slots via Sysvar, so if you’re querying an older block it’s gotta be indexed. Doesn't seem like it's going to be added to RPC for now, so closing for time being.

If you really want this & get Triton or Helius to support it, then please reopen this issue 🙏

## Issue #386: Missing State field for TokenAccounts

### Description

When visiting the page for Token Accounts the state field is not displayed. This is an important field - both for users and devs. As tokenization picks up steam, this will be an evermore important piece of information.

Example from other explorer: https://solscan.io/account/yU1Se7d7hKqFfs1NijH6cirMYQBfALA2C5kn8XQ8ynG

The possible account states:

## Issue #370: Responsive Design Issue: Block Details Overflow on Mobile in Solana Explorer

**Status:** open  
**Author:** @conveyGhost  
**Created:** 2024-08-31T00:54:26Z  
**Updated:** 2024-08-31T04:29:39Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/370](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/370)  
**Comments:** 1

### Description

**Describe the bug**
There is an overflow issue in the blocks information section when viewing the Solana Explorer on a mobile device. The data within the 'Overview' section is not properly contained within the screen boundaries, causing it to overflow horizontally. This affects readability and user experience, as users have to scroll sideways to view all the information.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to the Solana Explorer on a mobile device.
2. Navigate to the 'Overview' section of any block (e.g., by searching for a specific block or using the block navigation).
3. Scroll horizontally in the 'Overview' section.
4. Notice that the information overflows and is not fully visible without horizontal scrolling.

**Example Links**
-   https://explorer.solana.com/block/286847610

**Expected behavior**
The block information in the 'Overview' section should be responsive and fit within the screen boundaries on mobile devices. There should be no horizontal scrolling needed to view all the information.

## Issue #362: [Bug] Opaque stake accounts on testnet and devnet

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @CriesofCarrots  
**Created:** 2024-08-22T17:03:55Z  
**Updated:** 2024-08-29T16:30:35Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/362](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/362)  
**Comments:** 0

### Description

**Describe the bug**
Stake accounts on testnet and devnet aren't being parsed properly because stake-account pages depend on the `getStakeActivation` RPC method, which was removed in agave-validator v2.0

The correct way to figure out stake-activation info is client side ([example in rust](https://gist.github.com/joncinque/ccd5166a857d629f30b2c01cd010041d)).

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to explorer.solana.com
2. Switch to testnet or devnet cluster
3. Find a stake account address and load
4. Error in dev console: `SolanaJSONRPCError: failed to get Stake Activation FWWGaYEjXXVi1AwpEh9ZgvwZnfFYf2fEoKt3ZixxEv5a: Method not found`
5. Compare display to a mainnet-beta stake account

**Example Links**

## Issue #354: Distinction should be made between circulating, circulating withheld, permalocked, and burned supply

**Status:** open  
**Author:** @tapirtoken  
**Created:** 2024-07-19T06:13:40Z  
**Updated:** 2024-07-19T06:14:13Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/354](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/354)  
**Comments:** 0

### Description

**Describe the bug**

With reference to the existing supply display bug:

https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/issues/324

There are at least 4 categories of supply which have materially different economic and risk significance, and should be partitioned in the UI for clarity:

1. Circulating

These tokens are free to transfer.

2. Circulating Withheld

These tokens were collected from transfer fees and are not circulating but might eventually be because the Withdraw Authority is not Null.

3. Permalocked

These tokens were either collected as transfer fees with Null as Withdraw Authority, or were sent to

1nc1nerator11111111111111111111111111111111

In either case, if they're LP tokens, they still own a share in LP fees.

4. Burned

These tokens were destroyed using a Burn instruction. If these are LP tokens, the corresponding ownership share of the LP no longer exists. Major difference with #3.

**Example Links**

Here's an LP token that was used with the former TAPIR mint address:

B92UoeqcQZysFHmVz6bPjCLbFMH8gnYH2iqWf8Piou2j

As you can see, the supply is over 10M. But the 10M was sent to the incinerator (but not burned) long ago:

4vdhsQZPtRdwWyTcCdMLdr94fTMzjvtwtqMSzYqFDF3QZqS8bubj1FnW3JrxL9y418yxKmU8uvrjM4uEstsWiEm2

Now, that 10M isn't fully burned because it still represents an ownership share in the LP (and thus prevents other holders from usurping the entire pool). However, it's also not circulating in the sense that it would allow us to withdraw liquidity. A distinction should be made in the UI.

3. Send max amount of SOL to another wallet you own
4. You can verify that now how the explorer displays "Account does not exist" in the "Balance (SOL)" field

### Comment by @nickfrosty on 2024-04-20T12:50:20Z

This is as expected. When an account did exist and all its SOL (aka lamports) are transferred out, making its balance 0, the account gets garbage collected by the run time. Making it no longer exist

Ok, i understand, maybe is a too technical concept for general users do, but if you think that display that is enough we can close this issue

@nickfrosty what about for cNFT Accounts?  https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/issues/378


---

### Comment by @J4Web on 2024-10-26T18:45:47Z

@nickfrosty  Technically, that’s correct. However, it could be confusing for users who recently swapped all of their SOL (lamports) to another token like JUP. When they check their account on the explorer and see ‘Account not found,’ it might feel alarming. A clearer message could help prevent this confusion what do you think ? @JuanMarchetto 

---

### Comment by @nickfrosty on 2024-10-26T19:07:55Z

@philetos cnfts are not technically in accounts though. The way their hash id works looks similar because it's base58 encoded, but it functions very different.

@J4Web it could be alarming/concerning. A more clear message might be warranted though

## Issue #328: [Bug] Token name and symbol aren't shown when using metadata token extension

### Description

**Describe the bug**

Token name and symbol aren't shown at the top of token mint accounts when using metadata token extension 

**To Reproduce + Example Links**

1. Go to https://explorer.solana.com/address/Gq7JV5z3VVUSP17CBds1PqmYPnU9w3gVr2ZfB5fNTqtS?cluster=devnet. Observe that although the metadata is shown, the name and symbol for this token are not displayed.
2. Compare to https://solana.fm/address/Gq7JV5z3VVUSP17CBds1PqmYPnU9w3gVr2ZfB5fNTqtS/metadata?cluster=devnet-alpha

Right now Foundation's partners are Unboxed (who create our main self-directed Solana course) are having to use SolanaFM links instead of Explorer. We would generally try and avoid being king-maker and prefer to use just Solana Explorer.

**Expected behavior**

Name and image should be displayed.

**Screenshots**

## Issue #326: [Feature request] Add an explicit button for localhost 

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @mikemaccana  
**Created:** 2024-04-01T16:24:34Z

**Comments:** 1

### Description

**Describe the ~bug~ feature**

**I know this may seem silly** but: a lot of experienced Solana developers (from our classes, Hacker Houses, etc)  genuinely have no idea that Solana Explorer can connect to localhost. Obviously there's 'Custom RPC URL' which defaults to localhost but **people simply don't realise it's there**.  😅

Proposing the UI add a button for this, so the list looks like:

 - The official mainnet-beta URL
 - The official devnet URL
 - The official testnet URL
 - The default CLI localhost URL
 - Then allow users to specify any other URL they like

Obviously this is a simple change I'm just writing this here to convince you to make it or let me send you a PR! 😁

![Screenshot 2024-04-01 at 12 16 36](https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/assets/172594/543bdaec-3135-488a-b47f-a02bdd54a673)


**To Reproduce**

"Hey which of the well known addresses can Explorer connect to?"

"looks like mainnet-beta, devnet and testnet. I guess the 'Custom RPC' button is used to connect to mainnet-beta, devnet and testnet using a paid RPC provider like helius or Triton"

(months pass, get told you can actually use Explorer with localhost).

**Additional context**

Thanks for your consideration Noah! If you're busy I can make the PR too just LMK. 

### Comments

### Comment by @ngundotra on 2024-04-01T18:42:23Z

@mikemaccana by default, the Custom RPC Url will redirect back to localhost: see placeholder text

This should work 100% of time. If you're having issues using, ping me & we can debug

### Description

**Describe the bug**
Two aspects of Token Extensions projects display incorrectly on Explorer:
1. Withheld Amount
2. Fixed Supply (displays incorrectly for those Token Extensions projects with no withdraw authority for transfer fees, such as $CWIF and $LEIA).

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to a Token Extension page ([such as $CWIF](https://explorer.solana.com/address/7atgF8KQo4wJrD5ATGX7t1V2zVvykPJbFfNeVf1icFv1))
2. View "Fixed Supply" and "Withheld Amount ($CWIF)"
3. Compare to the [API endpoint](http://3.19.238.83/results) and [Helius script](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X5_gF40MaDE4vVMff_lkZ6BKWrBucOme/view?usp=sharing) used from the [catwifhat website](https://www.catwifhatsolana.com/)
4. The result: A discrepancy is found where the "Fixed Supply" shown by Explorer is 999,955,309,554,133.8. The correct Fixed Supply for $CWIF is 38,361,101,614,011.3 as the rest of the supply is inaccessible forever, using transfer fees with no withdraw authority.
5. The result: Another discrepancy is found where the "Withheld Amount" shown on Explorer is 460,334,842,512,625.75, however the true number found from Max Supply - Circulating Supply = Withheld Amount is different. The correct Withheld Amount value is 961,594,207,940,122.00.

**Example Links**
- Solana Explorer for $CWIF (the example): https://explorer.solana.com/address/7atgF8KQo4wJrD5ATGX7t1V2zVvykPJbFfNeVf1icFv1
- Solana Explorer for $LEIA (another coin that has a transfer fee with no withdraw authority): https://explorer.solana.com/address/7usVzynPTUJ9czdS96ezm9C6Z3hCsjb7j6TMKipURyyQ

**Expected behavior**
- Solana Explorer should display the circulating supply in place of the Fixed Supply for Token Extensions projects without a withdraw authority. The withheld tokens are out of circulation forever (effectively burned).
- [Here is a Helius query that provides the circulating supply for $CWIF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X5_gF40MaDE4vVMff_lkZ6BKWrBucOme/view), for example. 38.36 trillion is the true Fixed Supply, and the value will only ever go down. This means that it is also the Fixed Supply.
- Projects with no Token Extension withdraw authority will only ever have a decrease in circulating supply from transfer fees. Effectively, for all projects without a withdraw authority, their circulating supply is equivalent to the Fixed Supply and should ideally be displayed as such on Explorer.

**Screenshots**
1. A screenshot of the history of $CWIF’s supply and how 960+ trillion $CWIF should appear in the Withheld Amount, as they are out of circulation forever using Token Extensions transfer fees.
2. A screenshot from Solscan (which uses Explorer data) showcasing the incorrect “Current Supply” and “Market Cap” for $CWIF. The correct “Current Supply” is 38.6 trillion, and the correct market cap is $12,295,305.
3. A screenshot from Solana Explorer showing the incorrect “Withheld Amount” for $CWIF. The value shown is 460,334,842,932,625.75 while the true amount is 961,594,207,940,122.00.

**Additional context**
Since November, I have used Token Extensions (then called Token22) to create my project catwifhat. I have known that the Withheld Amount displays incorrectly since I started and have tried to navigate this, talking through the issue with Helius, FluxBeam, Solscan, SolanaFM, Birdeye, and other sources that display the incorrect Fixed Supply, Withheld Amount, and Market Cap for $CWIF. Nobody seems to know where the current incorrect Withheld Amount is calculated from my discussions, and the Fixed Supply does not take into consideration locked Withheld Amounts for tokens such as $CWIF and $LEIA as well.

I know for certain that 960 trillion+ $CWIF have been removed from circulation using Token Extensions (with some extra context in the screenshot provided), however the Withheld Amount has only shown as around 460 trillion since the project launched. One way to calculate the correct Withheld Amount for Token Extensions projects would be to take the Max Supply - Circulating Supply = Withheld Amount.

I really appreciate efforts looking into fixing this as it would help all Token Extensions projects with a Withheld Amount to see the correct information. Additionally the fix to Fixed Supply would help ease holder’s concerns of those projects that use the transfer fee as a burn mechanism by revoking all withdraw authorities, such as $CWIF and $LEIA.

## Issue #316: [Bug] Anchor IDL not showing for program

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @mcintyre94

**Comments:** 1

### Description

**Describe the bug**

A user asked on stackexchange why their anchor IDL doesn't show up on our Explorer: https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/9569/idls-explorers-curiosity

Explorer link to their program: https://explorer.solana.com/address/propm845StqEBV57ZSnTe8EW8duzAxo5p7h4inhibXV?cluster=devnet

I took a look at Explorer and I think the code that fetches the IDL is this:

https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/blob/5dcb64618bbbec58a4ec03ab2b8abe75ea92a19b/app/providers/anchor.tsx#L10-L37

I put a debugger on line 26 and viewed the reported program on devnet, and got an error "Tuple enum variants not yet implemented."
<img width="625" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-22 at 11 15 15" src="https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/assets/1711350/8d1d6253-3a56-4fe2-ab71-b59515a65570">

Their IDL does work on solscan: https://solscan.io/account/propm845StqEBV57ZSnTe8EW8duzAxo5p7h4inhibXV?cluster=devnet#anchorProgramIDL

It also has a suspicious looking enum field:
<img width="848" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-22 at 11 22 47" src="https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/assets/1711350/9a8cfcdb-4d8c-403b-9d9b-7fe420430ba9">

I'm guessing we need to update our version of Anchor to parse the newest IDLs

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to https://explorer.solana.com/address/propm845StqEBV57ZSnTe8EW8duzAxo5p7h4inhibXV?cluster=devnet, No Anchor IDL
2. Go to https://solscan.io/account/propm845StqEBV57ZSnTe8EW8duzAxo5p7h4inhibXV?cluster=devnet#anchorProgramIDL, Anchor IDL displays

**Example Links**

- https://explorer.solana.com/address/propm845StqEBV57ZSnTe8EW8duzAxo5p7h4inhibXV?cluster=devnet

**Expected behavior**

Show the Anchor IDL on this program!

## Issue #308: Feature Request -  Transaction Confirmation Time Stats

**Status:** open  
**Author:** @jdubpark  
**Created:** 2023-10-18T17:41:51Z  
**Updated:** 2023-10-18T17:41:51Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/308](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/308)  
**Comments:** 0

### Description

**Idea**
It'd be nice to see various stats for transaction confirmation time on the official explorer. Below is a screenshot of [validators.app](https://validators.app) and their "Ping Thing" [metrics](https://www.validators.app/ping-thing?locale=en&network=mainnet), which measures the min, median, p90, and latency of transaction inclusion in Solana.

**Why build the feature on the official explorer?**
Anatoly occasionally tweets about the p90 transaction inclusion time, and more people find the information valuable when building on Solana. It'd also be nice to have another data source, so people can cross-check the data and be more confident of transaction inclusion time stats.

**Some other thoughts**
Maybe the explorer can also add stat for the interval between tx inclusion and confirmation (quorum). In other words, show (1) how long it takes for a tx to get included (2) for the tx to get confirmed (32 confirmations).

These metrics would most likely change in value as block-building by Jito clients becomes more prevalent — most transactions will be included in set intervals, as blocks are sealed at every X milliseconds. In that case, I think it'd also be valuable to display the above metrics in the context of blocks, e.g. inclusion and confirmation time measured in seconds and blocks.

## Issue #297: Page data should be sourced from local cache when pressing back button (if not the entire page from the bfcache)

**Comments:** 0

### Description

**Describe the bug**
When you click back to visit a page that you have already been to, we fetch data anew. This contributes to folks blowing the rate limit on the RPC and getting 429 HTTP errors.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Visit an account page
2. Click on a transaction
3. Click the back button

**Expected behavior**
No network requests should be made when you return to the account page in a short enough amount of time.

**Additional context**
This is probably a massive amount of work that should start with the complete reimagining of how we fetch data in the Explorer. All of the things that next.js gives you for free in terms of [caching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching), we don't get, and we need to examine what it is about our architecture that opts us out of that default.

### Comment by @jstarry on 2023-10-20T11:03:17Z

I took a look at this and I think we should take a different approach rather than using a `fetch` shim. Using a shim is supposed to provide a convenient catch-all for batching account requests and is most useful when it's difficult to construct a code path that batches requests but I don't think it's too common. In the event that we have a bunch of different places requesting accounts at the same rendering step, chances are that some of the params will be different and therefore the requests can't be batched anyways. I'm also just not in favor of magic shims that increase complexity and error surface area.

---

### Comment by @steveluscher on 2023-10-20T20:22:06Z

Thanks for taking a look!

Magic is sometimes bad, yes. In the case we're dealing with here the calls are going through third-party code (`@metaplex/js`) where `fetch` is the only common denominator.

https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/blob/e7ee73dcf7aa781256129360375fa31216f43471/app/components/common/Address.tsx#L105-L106

Things we could do:

1. Wrap `globalThis.fetch` and coalesce similar requests
2. Instead of `new Connection()` in `useTokenMetadata` we could pass the Metaplex code a `Connection`-conforming object that actually uses the `MultipleAccountFetcher` under the hood when Metaplex calls `getAccountInfo()` on it.
3. Eliminate `@metaplex/js` and fetch the data ourselves

As the person who suggested it, I obviously prefer the general solution of shimming `globalThis.fetch`. It sounds completely nuts, but is [actually what next.js does under the hood](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) to implement client-side route caching ([link](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/888c3a7439d5965d98bdcbcf5f249f2fe8d1a6f2/packages/next/src/server/lib/patch-fetch.ts#L152-L621))!

---

### Comment by @jstarry on 2023-10-21T04:41:41Z

I think caching makes sense to do in an override because it can be generically implemented. This coalescing is inherently not possible to do generically and is brittle in the case that the response structure of getMultipleAccounts and getAccountInfo change independently

When using the txinspector page of the Solana Explorer (https://explorer.solana.com/tx/inspector) it does interpret neither information about the transaction from known programs (SystemProgram) nor for programs with Anchor IDL.

For example. A transaction that transfers a sol. Inspector says only

@mcintyre94 happy to help explain how the anchor stuff works, but this seems like p small useful change.

Feel free to unassign urself. Lmk what you what this protocol to be. 

Separately from this issue, I think I should probably transfer admin role to you or @steveluscher  & be unassignable 😂

## Issue #285: [Bug] Distribution Tab Missing?

### Description

There was a Distribution Tab where we could view top token holders and the relative distribution. Is this intentionally missing now?

Seems like this was available in the old create react app implementation
```  
 {
      slug: "largest",
      title: "Distribution",
      path: "/largest",
 }
```

I think I removed this because it wasn't working on mainnet. See https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/issues/210. The JSON RPC function used for this is [`getTokenLargestAccounts`](https://docs.solana.com/api/http#gettokenlargestaccounts). The RPC provider that we're using for Explorer (and AFAICT, most RPC providers) don't index token accounts on mainnet:

```
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "error": {
        "code": -32010,
        "message": "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA excluded from account secondary indexes; this RPC method unavailable for key"
    },
    "id": "cf555c33-087d-419c-9dd3-36e5df2bf16f"
}
```

See related: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/issues/2547 

Did you have a use case where this tab was providing useful data previously?

### Comment by @philetos on 2023-08-23T15:38:42Z

> Did you have a use case where this tab was providing useful data previously?

I am building an experience where the users earn various community tokens in their PDA Wallet...and I expose a link to the account on chain from within the app. From there it is nice to have the top token distribution visible from the associated Mint accounts for transparency.

Would be a nice way to encourage trust as we are all looking to onboard "non" crypto natives :]

@mvines is the explorer meant to be Apache 2.0 as well? If so, I can add the LICENSE file to this PR as well for easy merging... Currently, there is no LICENSE file at at all in the repo.

hey @steveluscher, can you please take this. I swear we did have a license in package.json at one point.
I don't feel strong if we do MIT/BSD or Apache2, and the Copyright would be attributed to Solana Labs

## Issue #271: Support multiple domain types

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @mcintyre94

### Description

Currently we only support Bonfida .sol domains, using the Bonfida SDK directly

I suggest that we use the [solana-wallet-names](https://github.com/portalpayments/solana-wallet-names) SDK from Portal Payments instead, which supports multiple domain types

This will give us support for many domain providers at once

As this SDK includes ANS addresses, this will also handle #205 (without favouring any provider) and supersede #236 with less code to maintain in Explorer. 

### Comments

### Comment by @mikemaccana on 2024-01-19T16:52:46Z

Author of solana-wallet-names here (I now work at Foundation). Definitely agree that supporting all name services rather than favoring Bonfida is good.

 - It would be reasonable to add a layer of caching, maybe 1 hour, so we don't bother upstream wallet name services.
 - If we decide to support multiple name services, we should let the various wallet services know we are intend on supporting their name services on the next wallet call.

## Issue #269: [Bug] Token distribution UI doesn't work, RPC won't fetch accounts

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @mcintyre94  
**Created:** 2023-07-12T14:12:50Z  
**Updated:** 2023-07-12T17:05:39Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/269](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/269)  
**Comments:** 3

### Description

**Describe the bug**

The token distribution tab makes an RPC call to `getTokenLargestAccounts. It gets an error response:
```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "error": {
        "code": -32010,
        "message": "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA excluded from account secondary indexes; this RPC method unavailable for key"
    },
    "id": "fdc6addf-3166-4169-8dac-85ec88b5672d"
}
```

The "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA excluded" suggests that this will error for all tokens, it's not particular to the token being loaded. And this seems to be the case, all tokens I've checked on mainnet give a similar response.

This results in the UI displaying that the largest accounts failed to load. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Go to https://explorer.solana.com/address/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v/largest
See Distribution tab

Note that devnet works correctly, eg: https://explorer.solana.com/address/GqGn2LFgZYLhjikiSYW6Q4w26JXxnxBRuNMFmT3MjB6M/largest?cluster=devnet 

**Example Links**

-  mainnet (USDC, error): https://explorer.solana.com/address/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v/largest
- mainnet (Orca, error): https://explorer.solana.com/address/orcaEKTdK7LKz57vaAYr9QeNsVEPfiu6QeMU1kektZE/largest
- devnet (works): https://explorer.solana.com/address/GqGn2LFgZYLhjikiSYW6Q4w26JXxnxBRuNMFmT3MjB6M/largest?cluster=devnet 

**Expected behavior**

The RPC should return the largest token accounts and the UI should display them

Closing, looks like we already found this bug and planned to remove the panel: https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/issues/210

That'll also simplify #268 where I hit this so win/win

Yeah, Triton nerfed that call on purpose. It's too expensive.

## Issue #262: Instruction log parsing could be better sanitized

**Status:** open  
**Author:** @sintemal  
**Created:** 2023-06-27T15:49:41Z  
**Updated:** 2024-04-09T10:44:53Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/262](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/262)  
**Comments:** 0

### Description

Currently, the explorer parses the hierarchy of inner instructions based on the program logs:
https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/blob/7b6116dfdda770c82fa41190cb52b0ffba8f329e/app/utils/program-logs.ts#L91C49-L91C49 

Especially the parsing of program returns based on log.includes("success") and log.includes("failed") seems a bit flawed, 
as the logs of native programs do not have the `Program log:` prefix like normal programs and, therefore, do not get filtered out beforehand. 
This means that if a native program emits a log message containing success or failure, the parsing is incorrect.
One could achieve this by using
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/0cd57addcf4ae242e0d068d09fc0359a4249a5e6/programs/zk-token-proof/src/lib.rs#L33

or, -as the zk-token-proof program doesn't seem to be deployed yet- by grinding a Pubkey containing the string and using one of the various other logs: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/2210af60ee615eda44bd3afc0b2093c23600a005/program-runtime/src/invoke_context.rs#L600

I guess the best fix here would be using a regex similar to the parsing of an invoked program.

## Issue #260: Correction Suggestion for Concurrent Merkle Tree Component in app/components/account/ConcurrentMerkleTreeCard.tsx

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @philetos  
**Created:** 2023-06-24T21:15:28Z  
**Updated:** 2023-06-26T21:58:23Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/260](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/260)  
**Comments:** 3

### Description

Hello,

I would like to bring a potential correction to your attention regarding the Concurrent Merkle Tree component located in the file `app/components/account/ConcurrentMerkleTreeCard.tsx` in the project. Please correct me if I am wrong, but I believe there are unnecessary subtraction and addition operations in two specific table rows that display the current number of leaves and the remaining leaves.

Currently, the code snippet in question appears as follows:

```typescript
<tr>
    <td>Current Number of Leaves</td>
    <td className="text-lg-end">
        <span className="text-monospace">{rightMostIndex - 1}</span>
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Remaining Leaves</td>
    <td className="text-lg-end">
        <span className="text-monospace">{Math.pow(2, treeHeight) - rightMostIndex + 1}</span>
    </td>
</tr>
```

If my understanding is correct, I would like to propose a modification to improve the accuracy of the displayed values by removing these unnecessary operations.

In the first table row, subtracting 1 from rightMostIndex seems redundant since rightMostIndex already represents the index of the rightmost leaf. Therefore, the subtraction can be omitted:

```typescript
<tr>
    <td>Current Number of Leaves</td>
    <td className="text-lg-end">
        <span className="text-monospace">{rightMostIndex}</span>
    </td>
</tr>
```

Similarly, in the second table row, adding 1 to rightMostIndex might not be necessary. I suggest the following modification:

```typescript
<tr>
    <td>Remaining Leaves</td>
    <td className="text-lg-end">
        <span className="text-monospace">{Math.pow(2, treeHeight) - rightMostIndex}</span>
    </td>
</tr>
```

By making these adjustments, we can present the correct values in a more straightforward manner, eliminating any potential confusion.

Please review this suggestion and let me know if I have misunderstood any aspects of the code. Your feedback and insights are highly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Kind regards

Oh 100%. The logs are full of this stuff.

The context is that we [rescued](https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/pull/237) Explorer from the dead, and it's a miracle that there are _only_ this many rogue logs.

The site used to be based on a many-times-over-deprecated version of Create React App. This year we modernized it all the way to the newest Next.js with the App Router infra. At each step of the process I made sure to _lock_ the version of each dependency so as no to introduce too much change at once. Now that we are on a (new) stable foundation, we can start eliminating and/or updating those dependencies to eliminate the kind of build warnings that you're seeing here.

I appreciate that this makes the logs messy, but would like to close this on the basis that – as you've said – everything seems to somewhat work, though.

## Issue #250: Readable description for "InsufficientFundsForRent"

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @jdubpark  
**Created:** 2023-05-31T20:55:43Z  
**Updated:** 2023-06-05T14:44:55Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/250](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/250)  
**Comments:** 0

### Description

Currently, the error message for "insufficient funds for rent" is parsed as "Unknown Error." Since this is a common error, it'd be nice to make the error more readable.

## Issue #248: Add instruction names for the Address Lookup Table program

**Status:** open  
**Author:** @steveluscher  
**Created:** 2023-05-19T17:34:01Z  
**Updated:** 2024-05-15T19:14:27Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/248](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/248)

### Description

Consider this transaction: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/2hJeZDCVdqsfDuwQbaf4hGBCaFVXJSfgzBnra5C384boi2iks4QjpKNwS8PQmzT2gHixQEk993PYh2c425RNcJdo

That calls the extend instruction on the address lookup table program, but despite that the UI reads ‘Unknown Instruction’

The task is to add instruction renderers for the address lookup table program.

## Issue #243: Render token name in page title

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @steveluscher  
**Created:** 2023-05-11T01:52:05Z  
**Updated:** 2023-06-05T19:37:29Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/243](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/243)  
**Comments:** 0

### Description

Consider this mint: https://explorer.solana.com/address/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v

The page title for that page is: `Transaction History | EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v | Solana`

The code that renders that page title is here:

https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/blob/9014bf54330a2589471c75e01dbb98c914e7fb48/app/address/%5Baddress%5D/page.tsx#L10-L15

The improvement is to render the _token name_ instead of the mint address, so that in Google the page title appears as `Transaction History | Token | USDC | Solana`

Considerations:

* It's very important not to create two URLs with the same page title. Consider the case where two tokens have identical names; how would you prevent their URLs from rendering the same title?
* Apply the same technique to all token-accessible routes underneath `/address/**`

The problem here is that `MultipleAccountsFetcher` can produce batch `getMutipleAccounts` calls that trigger this error:

> Too many inputs provided; max 5

### Description

**Describe the bug**
If you fetch the same address many times in a batch, `MultipleAccountsFetcher` will repeat the pubkey over and over in a `getMultipleAccounts` call.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

## Issue #233: [Bug] Honeyland got listed on coinGecko, but is still flagged

**Status:** open  
**Author:** @Tamgros

**Comments:** 0

### Description

**Describe the bug**
Honeyland got listed on coinGecko, but is still flagged in the explorer as potentially sppofed.

**To Reproduce**
It's my understanding that the steps to take off the warning in the explorer is to list on coinGeko
1. Setup token with the metaplex FT standard
2. Get listed on CoinGecko
3. The warning of being a duplicate doesn't go away

I haven't gone through full repro, but this is the current situation with Honeyland

**Example Links**
Here's the Token in question
https://explorer.solana.com/address/3dgCCb15HMQSA4Pn3Tfii5vRk7aRqTH95LJjxzsG2Mug

This is the Token on Coingecko
https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/honeyland

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is the warning banner at the top goes away once the token is listed on coingecko

**Screenshots**

## Issue #229: [Bug] Warning message shown for a Token which misleads the audience

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @solankirohan  
**Created:** 2023-03-12T20:19:10Z  
**Updated:** 2023-12-29T23:02:47Z

**Comments:** 2

### Description

**Describe the bug**
After creating a spl-token by following the recommended steps like creating a metadatav2 instruction with valid token metadata format and a uri which points to a json file, explorer site shows a message - "Warning! Token names and logos are not unique. This token may have spoofed its name and logo to look like another token. Verify the token's mint address to ensure it is correct."

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create an spl-token by following the steps mentioned [here](https://spl.solana.com/token#example-creating-your-own-fungible-token)
2. After successfully minting the token open the mint address in the [explorer](https://explorer.solana.com) site. 
3. Observe the Warning message in pink - "Warning! Token names and logos are not unique. This token may have spoofed its name and logo to look like another token. Verify the token's mint address to ensure it is correct."

**Example Links**
- https://explorer.solana.com/address/EZAxbt341NUi7MYCX6rUdiUS87A2Tycv2otfBBwRcGsa
- https://explorer.solana.com/address/o1Mw5Y3n68o8TakZFuGKLZMGjm72qv4JeoZvGiCLEvK

**Expected behavior**
If the metadata is provided with valid uri then explorer should **NOT** show the warning message.
Earlier it was required to register the token by raising a PR on the [registry](https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list) repo, but now this repo is EOL and it is now required to create a metadatav2 instruction with valid token metadata format and a uri which points to a json file. Hence, the newly created token should be treated same as any other token which is part of the initial registry list and should not show the warning message. This message misleads the token audience who may feel it could be an incorrect token. NOTE: No such message is shown on solscan site.

Hi, we are having the same issue here.  Our token is minted according to the standards provided in the EOL announcement of the SPL Token list repo. Our token has a valid token metadata format and a uri which points to a json file. But, the spoofed token warning message is displayed: 

https://explorer.solana.com/address/FEXoYTghBykVXy8Rvm7QSVEvC2NvucGJWTGipoPbyDi1/metadata

Not sure what the problem is here, the PRs here #288 and #289 seem to merged to Master by  @steveluscher  but have they been deployed to production? 

Is is not better to completely remove this warning until a better verification paradigm is agreed upon ?

Thanks

### Comment by @steveluscher on 2023-12-29T23:02:46Z

The verification paradigm is ‘appearing in the Solflare Unified Token List,’ @codefuturance.

**Comments:** 2

### Description

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

SPL Tokens (not metaplex NFTs) that have an `external_url` set in json metadata do not use that value for the `Website` field in the Solana Explorer.

https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/blob/411b42439553262ef9036985d287a7249acaad77/src/components/account/TokenAccountSection.tsx#L217-L231

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to https://explorer.solana.com/address/SHDWyBxihqiCj6YekG2GUr7wqKLeLAMK1gHZck9pL6y/metadata
2. Open the `uri` from the metadata, inspect that there's an `external_url` set in the metadata

**Example Links**
- https://explorer.solana.com/address/SHDWyBxihqiCj6YekG2GUr7wqKLeLAMK1gHZck9pL6y/metadata
- https://shdw-drive.genesysgo.net/GZ98NHzhDDvS5SdYEa9WLzMQSKMmu5nZb1wJpsYTFSxU/shdw-token.json

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

Expectation here is when `external_url` exists, that should be the value that's populated in the `Website` field instead of pulling from the deprecated `token_registry` that can no longer be updated.

### Comments

### Comment by @ngundotra on 2023-02-21T22:35:06Z

Thanks for flagging this Tracy.

However I think you're saying that the format of your off-chain `uri` is a JSON that has an `external_uri`, and this is what should be rendered in the `Website` row, rather than whatever was in Tokenlist. However, I think this is an unusual spec for Token Metadata. 

I think it's probably better to remove the `website` item from metadata since it is not present in the Solflare token list API. @jacobcreech @jnwng @steveluscher thoughts?

---

### Comment by @tracy-codes on 2023-02-21T23:56:22Z

The off-chain `uri` is a JSON that is compliant with the Metaplex Token Metadata standard which is what's outlined to follow when setting up a SPL token now.

The Metaplex Metadata Token standard has `external_url` as a field which has a description of `URI pointing to an external URL defining the asset — e.g. the game's main site.`. See their documentation here: https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/token-standard#the-fungible-asset-standard.

I think it would be better to follow the token metadata standard and solfflare can then also add a website item to their token list API to be compliant with the token metadata standard. SPL Tokens should have a website reference for the company or project so users can get more information about the token through explorers and APIs.

It's definitely from `TpsCardBody`, but not sure if it's from excessive chart rendering or an abuse of network calls

### Comment by @ngundotra on 2023-02-13T17:30:17Z

Issue comes from React Chartjs failing to properly display the large #s returned by `getRecentPerformanceSamples`

## Issue #207: Solana Explorer: Token display names vs addresses in detailed mode

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @amilz  
**Created:** 2023-01-10T03:54:33Z  
**Updated:** 2025-02-27T02:27:02Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/207](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/207)  
**Comments:** 1

### Description

#### Problem
Solana Explorer Token Details tab loses known token names for some tokens (my hunch is those with newer Metaplex metadata post token registry). See example below: 

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85324096/211457978-7d416ac5-4b3f-4772-849f-2dc7d2d4861d.mov

Expected Results: either mint token display name is displayed for all tokens in or the public key is show for all in detailed mode (not a mix of both).

Experienced: (see video) some tokens toggle to Public Key in detailed mode while others maintain their display name (eg, Samo). 
[Link to example](https://explorer.solana.com/address/FgrpCC6E1xXH5E4nFM4mBvCvmocJHcm2hf6Fdbz9xFtX/tokens?display=detail)

#### Proposed Solution

My hunch is there's a state issue with the token registry and the newer metaplex metadata. Probably an easy fix. I'll try to do some research when I have more time. 

### Comments

### Comment by @amilz on 2023-01-10T05:40:15Z

The `<Address >` component for `mint` is passed with parameters `link` and `truncate` at line 133: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/db0bff06686c9b1778fd99f2fa376aa72b99d749/explorer/src/components/account/OwnedTokensCard.tsx#L133


Here's where the `addressLabel` is defined: 
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/db0bff06686c9b1778fd99f2fa376aa72b99d749/explorer/src/components/common/Address.tsx#L46-59

```typescript
  let addressLabel = raw
    ? address
    : displayAddress(address, cluster, tokenRegistry);

  var metaplexData = useTokenMetadata(useMetadata, address);
  if (metaplexData && metaplexData.data)
    addressLabel = metaplexData.data.data.name;
  if (truncateChars && addressLabel === address) {
    addressLabel = addressLabel.slice(0, truncateChars) + "…";
  }

  if (overrideText) {
    addressLabel = overrideText;
  }
```

Since `raw` is not called in `<Address>`, any token in the `tokenRegisry` will return their `name`. 
`useMetaData`, however, is not called, so newer tokens would not return their `name`. 

**Proposed Solution**
Update https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/db0bff06686c9b1778fd99f2fa376aa72b99d749/explorer/src/components/account/OwnedTokensCard.tsx#L133
with
- Option A: add `raw` : `<Address pubkey={tokenAccount.info.mint} link truncate raw /> ` 
outcome: display only truncated addresses for all
- Option B: add `useMetadata` : `<Address pubkey={tokenAccount.info.mint} link truncate useMetadata /> ` 
outcome: display names for any with names (should match the basic view)

Personally, I prefer option B even in detail but I think there's a strong case for Option A. 
I'll try and give these a test later this week and can get a PR put together. LMK if you have an opinion!

### Description

#### Problem
<!--
  The GitHub issue tracker exists to track issues
  that affect the development of Solana itself.

  If you need technical support using Solana, building
  an app, or running a validator, don't open an issue here.

  Instead, post your question to the Solana Stack Exchange:
  https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/ask
-->
Ecosystem teams want to give visibility to their program on the explorer to gain adoption.
The explorer also wants to encourage innovation and reduce friction between seeing a program on the explorer and engaging with it (perhaps on another site).

However the explorer team does not have bandwidth to manually review appropriate changes to the explorer, and we want to be impartial when it comes to promoting community programs.
<!-- If reporting a crash, degraded performance, etc, please include the software version(s) you are using. -->

#### Proposed Solution

Create an SPL program to allow program authority (or frozen program deployer) to upload information about a program that can be shown on the Solana Explorer.

Such information may include:
- Program maintainer email address
- Github repository
- Program maintainer(s) wallet address (for tips, inquiries, etc)
- Relevant website for more information

Perhaps more fields if necessary.

### Comments

### Comment by @nvsriram on 2023-01-17T22:39:52Z

The reason why the tx signatures are repeated (10 times in this case) is because each unique tx signature for the transaction corresponds to 10 `Token Program: Mint To` instructions. The code extracts the name of the instruction (`Mint To`) and any inner instructions that exist for each instruction per unique tx signature. So that's why we have 10 rows that look identical but technically correspond to 10 different instructions for every tx signature.
What would be the desired behaviour though?

### Comment by @t-nelson on 2023-01-17T22:50:28Z

could we collapse them into one entry, similarly to how inner instructions are treated?

We could flat map all the instructions such that every instruction (including inner instructions) corresponds to a separate row with hyperlinks to that specific instruction. This would be consistent with the serial order in which all the instructions are executed. Would this solve the issue?

### Comment by @t-nelson on 2023-01-19T06:21:47Z

i think it's more important to retain the instruction hierarchy than the links.  i don't personally see any value in being able to navigate to a particular instruction from that page.  that is, i don't care which instructions touch a token account, just which transactions do.

### Comment by @nvsriram on 2023-01-19T16:42:59Z

Each transaction with more than one instruction can be expanded as shown in the screenshot. The inner instructions expand as they did before. Would this be consistent to what you had in mind?

## Issue #205: explorer: add ANS domain names to account details and enable searching by domain names

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @tonivlad  
**Created:** 2022-12-16T20:13:52Z  
**Updated:** 2024-09-14T14:48:44Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/205](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/205)  
**Comments:** 4

### Description

#### Problem

Add **ANS** (Alternative Name Service) by **Onsol Labs** domain name support to the Explorer
- enable searching by ANS domains
- enable showing domains owned by an address

ANS is a protocol similar to Bonfida's SNS (.sol) that enables any project on Solana to have their own TLD ( .anything ) with a few extra features like 
- it's written in anchor
- domains can be expirable ( people own them for a limited amount of time, after which they need to renew them, like .eth )
- realloc

We're starting with a few communities/projects to enable TLDs for them before going public with the protocol.

The process to create a new TLD is first come first serve but currently involves talking to us, because we are trying to filter the first projects to make sure they are they are projects that have stood the test of time and have a long term plan.
We're doing this also because we want to see what other features they require.

we're currently in talks with: 
- **MonkeDAO** for **.monke** 
- **ThugDAO** for **.thug**
- **Frakt** for  **.frakt**
and a few other projects

also talking with
- **Matrica** to enable Discord gating through domain ownership
- **Solana.fm** to enable owned domains list
- **Helius Labs** for domain indexing
- **Brave** browser to enable sending to ANS domains in their wallet
- **Ultimate Finance** wallet to enable sending to ANS domins
and a few other projects

We are already included in **Dialect**'s sdk to enable sending messages to our domains
[https://github.com/dialectlabs/sdk/](https://github.com/dialectlabs/sdk/)

To make all this happen we wrote three programs:
1. **ANS** - alternative name service
2. **TldHouse** - enables creation and management of the TLDs through the ANS
let's a project (TLD owner) chose to let the community claim domains using
          - any SPL token
          - SOL
          - only owners of a certain NFT collection can claim/buy a domain
4. **NameHouse** - domain NFT wrapping/unwrapping to enable trading on any NFT marketplace

**Onsol Labs** is currently self funded/bootstrapped but we applied for a grant from Solana Foundation both through the normal channel and the MonkeDao initiative.

**Being included in the Solana Explorer would help a lot with our other integration efforts.**

The long term plan for the protocol is to go decentralised - a good example what we have in mind is ENS on Ethereum.

Thank you for explaining your contracts! We want to allow ecosystem projects to add their own annotations and (to some extent) UI for their smart contracts in the new year. We will explain how we plan on doing this in a separate issue in the new year.

Hey thank you for bringing this up. We're not considering changes to the explorer UI that prioritize one protocol over another right now. However, we would love to support this as much as we can through the framework proposed here: https://github.com/solana-labs/explorer/issues/196

If you have a proposal on how to handle searching for programs, more generally than just for ANS name extensions, let us know :)

Explorer should not be a place to integrate these complex thing-a-majiggers. Specifically:
- Domain integration is poorly documented
- Domain integration shows ecosystem favoritism
- It's lazy

#### Proposed Solution

Strip out solana-labs/solana#20911. Instead of adding this integration into the UI,  there should be a way to automatically query program state based on an IDL.

## Issue #208: explorer: Ping charts is misleading by RPC status

**Comments:** 1

### Description

When RPC service has some issues, the ping status is misleading. The result can only reflect the user experience for the people who use the same RPC service with the ping  chart but not the rest of users. 
There were many " connect: connection refused "  and "503-service-unavailable" errors contribute to high ping time in below chart .
![Screenshot from 2022-12-15 16-04-43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26322328/207810214-cef75e2a-bdd0-4e23-9fc8-86b40387291a.png)

If we can show RPC status in the chart, it helps users to know what causes those high bars.

### Description

#### Problem
Blocks are by definition immutable. Client should not hit, for instance, `getBlock()` over and over and over. Here's the change that needs to be made.

#### Proposed Solution

1. Change the frontend to query [explorer.solana.com/api/block/{BLOCKNUM}](http://explorer.solana.com/api/block/%7BBLOCKNUM%7D)
2. Move the getBlock call into /pages/api/block/[blocknum].ts
3. Cache the result of the local API call at the edge, using Vercel caching. Docs [here](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/caching#serverless-functions).

Note: you can do lambdas on Vercel without Next.js: https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions

## Issue #210: explorer: Eliminate `getTokenLargestAccounts` queries

**Comments:** 0

### Description

#### Problem

Triton One reports that queries of this form:

```json
{
  "method":"getTokenLargestAccounts",
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "params":["EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v", {"commitment":"confirmed"}],
  "id":"b5c5071f-703a-4db6-85d9-90ec4e6102c9"
}
```

Are dysfunctional in that they:

1. Require that `spl-token-mint` be loaded on the RPC servers,
2. Even so, this results in 5 minute query times which is unusable to begin with.

Example: https://explorer.solana.com/address/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v/largest

#### Proposed Solution

Remove all queries of this type from Explorer, like the ‘distribution’ tab on tokens.

## Issue #214: explorer: TransactionErrors thrown by simulations are not shown

**Status:** open  
**Author:** @billythedummy

**Comments:** 0

### Description

#### Problem

UI issue. When using the [explorer's transaction inspector](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/inspector) to simulate transactions, it appears that only `InstructionError`s are shown in the simulated program execution logs and `TransactionError`s are not displayed. This gives the false impression that a transaction should succeed when it will fail when actually executed.

To reproduce, simply generate a transaction that transfers `balance - getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(0) + 1` lamports from a SystemAccount. The `simulateTransaction` RPC call will return an `InvalidRentPayingAccount` `TransactionError` due to the source account dropping to below the rent exemption minimum, but no indication of a `TransactionError` seems to be given on the explorer transaction inspector. 

#### Proposed Solution

Display `TransactionError`s in the program logs after the instruction logs if there are any?

## Issue #201: explorer: Use Unified Token-list API

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @jacobcreech

**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/201](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/201)  
**Comments:** 3

### Description

#### Problem

Currently the explorer queries the following to get token-metadata:

1. Check if Token is in the legacy token-list
2. If not in token-list try on-chain via Metaplex Fungible token metadata

This has the following problems:

1. Wallets do metaplex fungible token metadata first, then legacy token-list. This allows someone with a token to update their metadata by creating the on-chain account
2. We have to load the legacy token-list on the front end to manage searching, querying, etc
3. Searching for on-chain metadata via the searchbar is not done today, and is not feasible via `getProgramAccounts` (nor recommended)

#### Proposed Solution

Solflare created a [Unified Token API](https://github.com/solflare-wallet/utl-api) that manages caching, searching, and verifying tokens via coingecko, legacy token-list, and Metaplex Fungible token metadata.

Proposal is to use it to create a faster experience for users on the explorer searching and viewing their tokens.

We have two options:

1. Deploy our own instance and use it
2. Use Solflare's public API https://token-list-api.solana.cloud (The team is fine with the explorer using it)

Proposing we use option 2 for speed to ship. Happy to work on it if consensus is met.

@jacobcreech can you provide some examples where the current behavior is incorrect, or unacceptably slow?

---

### Comment by @jacobcreech on 2022-12-14T19:51:09Z

Explorer currently uses [@solana/spl-token-registry](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/explorer/package.json#L24) which has a [scary large bundlesize of 1.1MB gzipped](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@solana/spl-token-registry@0.2.4574), adding up to 23s on slower network speeds. Doing these legacy token-list lookups on a backend is much faster.

Searchbar token logos seems to have since been removed when searching.

Coingecko as a first choice when looking up metadata can be added to unified token-list as well, removing issues with certain protocols trying to update their now locked token metadata and pushing liability to coingecko.
Example: Kin can't update their logo anymore and is incorrect on [our explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/address/kinXdEcpDQeHPEuQnqmUgtYykqKGVFq6CeVX5iAHJq6), while [solanafm](https://solana.fm/address/kinXdEcpDQeHPEuQnqmUgtYykqKGVFq6CeVX5iAHJq6?cluster=mainnet-qn1) and [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kin) have the updated logo.

## Issue #215: explorer: Ability to invoke programs from Solana Explorer, like you can on Etherscan

**Comments:** 6

### Description

#### Problem

A number of Ethereum developers have told me that the ability to view smart contract source code _and_ to invoke instructions directly from Etherscan was instrumental in helping them learn to build on Ethereum.

<img width="352" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13243/171488957-b9ebbe7e-5702-4a6e-a3fd-c81389ffc7ec.png">

Indeed, some _entire_ NFT projects on Ethereum, like https://beelinez.io/, never built a mint site; the way to mint Beelinez and [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/) for instance was to invoke a contract directly from Etherscan.

Folks have communicated to me that there's value in being able to trigger programs from the block explorer without having to pay the overhead of writing a command-line script or setting up a web/mobile app.

This is a feature proposal to add something similar to Solana Explorer.

#### Proposed Solution

I believe we have all of the pieces we need to do this right.

1. Programs written using the Anchor Framework produce an interface definition language (IDL) artifact. This is a list of all of the instructions you can send to a program, and the inputs each instructions expects ([example](https://anchor-program-registry-bucket-prod.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/anchor-program-registry-bucket-prod/staging/builds/548/artifacts/govern.json)). We could use this to build an instruction-creation-and-execution UI into Solana Explorer for a given program
2. The [Anchor Program Registry](https://anchor.projectserum.com/) is well on its way to cataloging source code for verified programs.

The flow would look like this:

1. Visit the address of an Anchor Program (eg. the [SPL Governance program](https://explorer.solana.com/address/GovHgfDPyQ1GwazJTDY2avSVY8GGcpmCapmmCsymRaGe))
2. Connect your wallet
3. Access a UI that presents to you:
   - a list of instructions that Anchor program supports
   - form fields you can use to configure the inputs for a given instruction
4. A button to sign and send a transaction to execute the instruction you've configured.
5. Display errors, or redirect to the transaction page for the transaction you just made.

### Comment by @jarry-xiao on 2022-06-02T17:19:39Z

Adding my 2 cents here: this could be an incredibly high value idea, but most of the difficulty comes from knowing the public key addresses that you would need to pass in to the instruction(s) in question. Client applications will often pull lots of dirty tricks for finding these keys (hard-code PDA seeds, hard code addresses, GPA). For this particular feature it almost feels like you would need to have the smart contract developer build out special instruction builders that automatically handle some of pubkey inference (very hard problem) for you. Instruction data seems more feasible.

There are other instructions that require a bit of workflow to get working as well. Let's take Serum for example:
1) You need to first initialize the market
2) You then need to place orders (NewOrder). You can only do this by knowing how the market was configured
3) You can only process trades with ConsumeEvents after something has interacted with the orders, and there's an incredibly specific format/ordering to how to pass in pubkeys for that instruction.
4) You can only call SettleFunds after a trade event has been processed with CE.

Overall this doesn't feel like something that generalizes well. Happy to discuss ways in which this could work for certain programs. I do think we could build out a very narrowly catered tool for specific programs to help developer learn the workflow, but I don't think it's feasible to build something universal that is actually practical. 

---

### Comment by @steveluscher on 2022-06-02T17:27:55Z

Super true. Crafting a useful instruction using such a UI for Serum would be brutal.

I think the use case here is more like:

* I'm learning Solana.
* I uploaded a program to devnet
* I load up my program in Explorer on devnet
* I poke and prod at it to see if it works

---

### Comment by @ngundotra on 2022-06-02T17:35:31Z

This seems very high value to have!

I think the greatest burden here is taking the best parts from on-going approaches across the ecosystem.
- Armani hinted that the Anchor Program Registry already has javascript bindings being emitted in the IDL
- Metaplex's shank IDL has on-going efforts to [annotate PDA-retrieval ](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/shank/issues/23) in the IDL

Not unreasonable to also extend the Shank approach to annotate workflows as well.

---

### Comment by @jarry-xiao on 2022-06-02T17:35:41Z

Maybe this makes the most sense as a separate application then? You use the `tx-builder` web application (configured for specific programs), and you have a history of all txs that have passed during testing with links to an explorer/solscan page.

You can maybe add in some helper methods for things that are generally useful (create account, create mint/TA) that return the user back some public keys that they can paste into their custom instructions if necessary.

I think this should replace `/inspect` tab, and should use something like https://github.com/labeleven-dev/bettercallsol

If you got room for more 2c, I'd like to throw in mine based on the journey I had to go through with [bettercallsol.dev](https://bettercallsol.dev).

I started off with an instruction invoker. This is something that [solana.fm](https://solana.fm/address/JUP4Fb2cqiRUcaTHdrPC8h2gNsA2ETXiPDD33WcGuJB/executable-program?cluster=mainnet-solanafmbeta) has started providing since.

<img width="922" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4444588/218886937-7eabc631-3989-411b-82b6-ba07146ccb3f.png">

This makes perfect sense for a Solana explorer. Your entry point is probably navigating to a program. I understand the scope of this GH issue is pretty limited but for posterity, I'll document what the natural progression was for me.

I quickly realised the tool's value is very limited unless the user can _compose_ an entire transaction. From there, based on my own dogfooding and user feedback, I found that a lot more features were required to make this tool actually useful.

Here is a non-comprehensive list of features I had to build, or will have to build:

* A library of accounts, programs and instructions
* Support for Anchor instructions, including infinitely(ish) nested structs and arrays
* Support for non-Anchor instructions, especially SPL 
* Versioned transaction and LUT support
* Import existing transactions
* Detect and convert imported transactions to Anchor
* Annotating and treating accounts based on their "type": Sysvar, token account, etc.
* Keypair management
* Support multiple encoding: Borsh, bufferlayout, hex, bs58, etc.
* Support for transaction simulation and offline transactions
* Generate PDAs
* Ability to share a prefilled transaction with others
* Display chain state for used accounts
* Etc.

## Issue #216: explorer: Make it more obvious when using an Anchor Program's name vs known Program Address

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @ngundotra  
**Created:** 2022-04-13T23:09:55Z  
**Updated:** 2024-09-03T19:42:25Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/216](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/216)  
**Comments:** 0

### Description

#### Problem

It's not clear when Anchor Name is being used. I think it would be more helpful for users to be able to quickly tell when a program is calling itself something versus being given a name from the explorer.


#### Proposed Solution

- Create separate component called <IDLAddress> that can work for any IDL 
- <IDLAddress> will link to the uri of the published IDL to allow users to check the information about the program 
- <IDLAddress> will show some UI indicator that the name being shown is derived from an unverified source (i.e. an asterick)

Benefit of being generic is that if an Anchor competitor appears (i.e. metaplex's Solita launches its own IDL) then we can reuse this component.

Example [in the wild](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/6EQsUPDhugGZWhxhdf9MixjcGivPjKyVxJSXarbgZknZsJt9itmk4vJqkuFoxCyfSz5rfE3LtRzNVoAcvDzBVD2) where "Jet" should have extra annotation:

## Issue #217: explorer: SPL transfers using wrapped sol accounts are not denominated in SOL

**Status:** open

### Description

#### Problem
In the following transaction, inner instruction `#7.1` transfers wrapped SOL but the transfer does not use SOL as a unit and doesn't include decimals:

#### Proposed Solution
Unchecked token instructions don't carry mint metadata. We should be able to pull this in from the token delta metadata (if available).

## Issue #223: explorer: Allow arbitrary search from a query URL

**Comments:** 2

### Description

#### Problem
There is no query URL to run a search in the explorer, but must be manually pasted into the search bar on the explorer home page. 

#### Proposed Solution
Add support for one.  This will allow for quick integration into custom tools or quick-search functionality from outside an existing explorer tab.

White space in the search input box will cause a valid search to have no results.
The solution is to auto trim white space when the user submits a query.

### Comment by @jstarry on 2020-10-21T03:09:11Z

@paul-schaaf before I dig into this, can you let me know if you waited ~20s before refreshing? Any account changes have to be confirmed before they show up in the explorer. If you refresh right after the transaction, it won't show up

---

### Comment by @paul-schaaf on 2020-10-21T08:17:55Z

@jstarry I didnt know I had to do that, maybe that info could be added somewhere in the explorer? That said, I did wait for 20 seconds now and that didn't fix it.

---

### Comment by @jstarry on 2020-10-21T08:30:02Z

No worries, thanks for checking. I'd like to fix this by adding a refresh button here. Does that solve your issue?

### Comment by @paul-schaaf on 2020-10-21T09:04:50Z

is there a need for another button? Why not let the existing refresh button refresh account holders and their balances correctly? @jstarry

### Comment by @jstarry on 2020-10-21T09:22:21Z

Not really a need, just convention I had been using. Agreed that existing refresh button should control it

## Issue #225: explorer: Not able to view "raw" account info for parsed accounts

**Status:** open  
**Author:** @jstarry  
**Created:** 2020-10-06T02:29:45Z  
**Updated:** 2023-02-16T17:26:09Z  
**URL:** [https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/225](https://github.com/solana-foundation/explorer/issues/225)  
**Comments:** 0

### Description

#### Problem
The explorer handles parsed accounts (tokens, stake, etc) differently from non-parsed accounts on the account details page. Rather than showing the SOL balance, account space, etc. it displays program specific information like token balance or activated stake. This means that some information is not readily available for parsed accounts or that Solana specific details are mixed with program specific details.

#### Proposed Solution
- Add a "Raw" toggle which behaves similarly to how the explorer displays parsed instructions
- Display the raw account data in HEX

## Issue #224: explorer: fetching token holdings is not limited

**Status:** open  
**Author:** @jstarry

**Updated:** 2023-02-16T17:24:58Z

**Comments:** 1

### Description

#### Problem
A single account can have many thousands of token holdings

Example: `6ZRCB7AAqGre6c72PRz3MHLC73VMYvJ8bi9KHf1HFpNk`

This means that the explorer will attempt to load the account history for each of those token accounts when loading token holding information. This can results in 10's of thousands of requests and will crash / freeze the browser

#### Proposed Solution
- Paginate / limit token holdings
- Batch token transfer history requests
- Refactor RPC calls to paginate holdings, maybe add a new method for token history

this showed up only after the confirmation landed.  might be due to confirmation coming from gossip first before a bank has been built.

## Issue #143: Blockhash is ambiguous on transaction details page

On transaction details:
Because it comes immediately after the "Block" number, the "Blockhash" reads as though it is the blockhash for that block, even though it is actually the recent blockhash submitted with the transaction.

Change the label to be more clear. "Recent blockhash" or "Transaction recent blockhash" might be enough?

The missing transaction history were a side-effect of the mainnet-beta restart and the lack of https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/10358 on v1.1.

We do in fact have these transactions in the RPC node ledger still

### Comment by @jstarry on 2020-06-03T11:30:30Z

@mvines I tried using the ledger-tool to print slot 10440804 and I get a blockstore error:

> Failed to load entries for slot 10440804: blockstore error

Did anything change since you queried earlier?

## Issue #128: Display dummy data for blocktimes of transactions too old to query

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @t-nelson  
**Created:** 2020-05-22T16:17:01Z  
**Updated:** 2020-05-23T08:57:00Z

**Comments:** 0

### Description

#### Problem

Currently the blocktime field is omitted on transactions that are too old to be queried from the cluster due to https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/10089. This can lead to community confusion, both innocent and malicious

#### Suggested solution

Display "Before LAST_QUERYABLE_DATE" or similar when we can't give a more precise date

### Comment by @jstarry on 2020-05-22T10:44:10Z

@jackcmay this is pretty tricky actually. Right now, the transaction details page is showing the "Readonly" and "Signer" tags by decoding the transaction message header. The "Program" is determined by decoding each instruction's program_id_index.

In order to show whether each account involved in an instruction is executable, we would need to fetch the info for all involved accounts. And that fetched state wouldn't necessarily match up with the state when the transaction was processed.

May I ask what prompted this issue? Seems to me that showing each instruction's specified program is sufficient. Is this related to cross program invocations?

Also, we already add the "Program" tag to the transaction accounts list.

---

### Comment by @jackcmay on 2020-05-22T17:34:27Z

What prompted it was my brain torqued a bit when I looked at the "Accounts" section.  When I think of "Accounts" I'm thinking of the state of the account on the chain, so executable tag seems a natural there and the lack makes me wonder.  Probably just bad context on my end since the whole page is in the context of the transaction.

What is the Raw Data?  Is that instruction data?  if so, maybe we should label it that and instead of base58 just list out the byte values?

This is great feedback! I'll fix up the copy then 👍

## Issue #120: Copy tooltips cutoff, not copying

### Description

There are lots of things in the Account and Transaction details screens that pop up a "Copy" tooltip on hover.

1. The copy-on-click doesn't actually seem to copy anything to clipboard; Firefox 76 and Chrome 81, macOS
2. The tooltip gets cutoff by some content frames:

@CriesofCarrots I just found out that clipboard support isn't enabled on http, https is required. I think that's probably what you were running into

Wow, good detective work @jstarry , thanks for following up! I wonder how I ended up on http; I'll keep an eye on all our links into the explorer.

## Issue #107: Can't see that locked up stake accounts aren't part of circulating supply

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @garious  
**Created:** 2020-05-11T17:58:28Z  
**Updated:** 2020-05-15T14:07:15Z

**Comments:** 2

### Description

#### Problem

When viewing an account, there's no indication that it is locked up and therefore not part of the circulating supply.

#### Proposed Solution

Add an indicator, perhaps in an "Account Details" dialog. Something that mimics the information currently available in the output of `solana stake-account <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>`.

### Comments

### Comment by @jstarry on 2020-05-15T11:01:45Z

@garious this info in the "Account Details" *page* now, is that sufficient?

## Issue #98: Explorer hits "Instruction type incorrect; not a SystemInstruction" on multi-sig txn

The following transaction splits a stake account, sets new stake and withdraw authorities, and performs a system transfer.  All instructions went through on the network without issue, but when I try to view the transaction details on the explorer, I land at a blank page, which @mvines states is due to the explorer hitting: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/57a37920d19ba6b629aed4aaf99d1b600dee1ceb/src/system-program.js#L181

Whoops! Thanks for the report. I fixed instruction type handling in the explorer and also created an issue for the web3 sdk to add support for these new instruction types: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/issues/new

@danpaul000 explorer has proper support for this type of transaction now: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3DuuBYU4mV61dthRVfZqY55f7ibJ8Bchdf4r7CVSfdQpCUcPugwmrQ3UTFnJ62wRWMKHkDqvwQbb5DBoB6tigTGj

## Issue #97: Transaction erroneously shows Not Found

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @CriesofCarrots

**Comments:** 0

### Description

Most of the time when I click the "View on Explorer" link in Break for a Pending transaction, the explorer page shows the transaction is not found, even though it is found on refresh.
Sometimes the webpage seems to flash the correct transaction details, but then reverts to Not Found.
Sometimes this also happens when inputting the url manually. Url is in this format:
`https://explorer.solana.com/tx/SQAaeoU5Ba9Ga38cpLTcTcqnUYjERsEJNyHgnjoXWMXgBbzfPSaA9ojfwfeBX71d853teDuQJ146scEfvqLiXgf?cluster=testnet`

It doesn't seem to matter how many confirmations the transaction has, although it seems somewhat less frequent for finalized transactions.

Firefox, MacOS

### Description

#### Problem
Users get really concerned when their past transactions are not queryable. This is due to our nodes only storing a few days of transaction history

#### Proposed Solution
Add a disclaimer when transactions are not found stating that this may be due to incomplete history

## Issue #80: Account lookup: getSignatureStatuses can fail on "too many inputs"

### Description

STR:
I searched for a random validator identity on mainnet-beta: `FopTvQaGp6K5FadWKZtsLJmrX7gnNGFS2fQ7rv5KHyE1`
Account lookup failed. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3030561/80133141-01162200-855a-11ea-9c85-9dbacf39ef7b.png)

Looks like `getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress` queried the max slots (10k) and passed all those signatures (~9500) into a `getSignatureStatuses` query, which failed on "too many inputs". `getSignatureStatuses` is capped at 256 inputs, so this request needs to be split into batches.
That said, do we need to load so many confirmed signatures at once? Wondering about lazy-loading. Would we need an rpc for the most recent confirmed signatures for address, limited by number of signatures instead of number of slots?

### Comments

### Comment by @CriesofCarrots on 2020-04-23T18:34:07Z

Related issue: searching for `Vote111111111111111111111111111111111111111` in Account lookup stalls the browser. Via command line, querying `getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress` for 10k slots of Vote signatures takes about 7sec for initial data to return, and 15sec to receive complete data.

3. Show transaction detail on `/tx/signature_hash` (also applies to `/transaction`, `/txn`
4. Instead of showing tx details in a modal, show them in a full page

Cluster selection should be sticky and not reset when a user refreshes the screen. Should store this in local storage

## Issue #10: Not showing signature confirmations

**Status:** closed  
**Author:** @jstarry  
**Created:** 2020-03-19T14:43:11Z

### Description

Blocked on https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/9138 being released

#### Problem
The explorer needs to know which slot a particular transaction was added to and how many confirmations that slot has. 

#### Proposed Solution
Wait for RPC update to get necessary information

@CriesofCarrots @mvines does this proposed solution look ok?

### Comment by @CriesofCarrots on 2020-03-20T16:05:19Z

When will you unsubscribe for missing statuses? After 32 new roots?

### Comment by @jstarry on 2020-03-20T16:43:52Z

Hmm sounds reasonable. I think never unsubscribing should be fine too in case someone is waiting for a particular transaction for an extended period of a time
